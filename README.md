# Description
This project combines a Progressive Web App (PWA) with Apple Shortcuts to create a flashlight for iOS that utilizes both the rear flashlight and the front screen to provide illumination. The rear flashlight and front screen can be turned on and off independently, and they can be made to flash. The PWA utilizes the [Screen Wake Lock API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Wake_Lock_API) to keep the screen on when the front screen is used for illumination.

# Links to Shortcuts needed for the flashlight to work:
* [Multi Light](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6fbe9df9c9fb4e58a3560f46223d22ff)
